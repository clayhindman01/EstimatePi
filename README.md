# EstimatePi

Program that requests a number for the amount of points on the the program generates. It creates random numbers from 0-1 and plots that on a graph. Is uses the ratio of how many points are in the circle vs how many points are in the square to estimate pi. The higher number of points, the more accurate pi will be.
